Dear {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

#What happens next

{% if not has_someone_to_shop and wants_supermarket_deliveries and wants_social_care %}

You should be able to start booking priority supermarket deliveries in the next 1 to 7 days, depending on the supermarket. You’ll need to book deliveries on the supermarket’s website.

Supermarkets have very few delivery slots left in December.

#Set up a supermarket account

If you do not already have an account with a supermarket delivery service, set one up now. You can set up accounts with more than one supermarket if you're worried about not getting a delivery slot. The participating supermarkets are:

- ASDA: https://www.asda.com
- Iceland: https://www.iceland.co.uk
- Morrisons: https://www.morrisons.com
- Ocado: https://www.ocado.com
- Sainsbury’s: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk
- Tesco: https://www.tesco.com
- Waitrose: https://www.waitrose.com

Your local authority will contact you to talk about any local support that may be available. This can take a week or so.
